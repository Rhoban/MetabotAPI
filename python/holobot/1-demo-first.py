# First, one adds the current directory to PYTHONPATH because we need
# to access to the holobot library: one supposes that you launch the
# command from your build directory.
# Note: this can be done manually within the launch command (PYTHONPATH=. python3 ...)
# you can add it also in your .bashrc
